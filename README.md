# Binarysearch
 Binary search is an efficient algorithm for finding an item from a sorted list of items. It works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. If the value of the search key is less than the item in the middle of the interval, the algorithm narrows the interval to the lower half. Otherwise, it narrows it to the upper half.
